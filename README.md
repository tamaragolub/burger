Homework Assignment

This assignment was to create an application that lets users input the names of burgers that they would like to eat. Whenever a user submits a burger name, the app will display the burger on the page, waiting to be devoured. Each burger in the waiting area has a devour button which will move the burger to a different area, showing that it was eaten.
